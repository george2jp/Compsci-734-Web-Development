   <h1>Assignment: Colour Spacing</h1>
   <p>
      This assignment familiarizes you with Colour Spacing and RGB and HSV convertion.
   </p>
   <h2>Part 1</h2>
   <p>
      <p>Given the colour C = (<span class="cws_code_q">GetRGBNumbers</span>) in RGB colour space.</p> 
	  <p>Assume that each colour componment is represented by a floating point number in the range 0 and 1
	  inclusive.</p>
	  <p>What is the complement of C?</p> 
	  <p>(WARNING:Your answer should have ONE decimal place, Format of answer: "(x,y,z)" WITHOUT any spacing!!! If you get 1, write as 1.0. OTHERWISE you lose marks!)</p>
   </p>
   <p><span class="cws_code_a">GetRGB</span></p>
   <h2>Part 2</h2>
   <p>
      <p>The CIE XYZ colour space may be represented as a projection on the 2D:
	  X+Y+Z = 1.</p> <p>Given the colour (<span class="cws_code_q">GetCIENumbers</span>),</p>
	  <p>what is the corresponding2D colour?,</p>
	  <p>(WARNING:Format of answer: (x,y), MUST round to TWO decimal places, WITHOUT any spacing!!! If you get 0.2, write as 0.20. OTHERWISE you lose marks!)</p>
   </p>
   <p><span class="cws_code_a">GetCIE</span></p>
   <h2>Part 3</h2>
   <p>
	  Find the Chromatic Aberration Value given that there are two RGB colour coordinates in RGB colour space, Xi = 
	  (<span class="cws_code_q">GetRGBSpace_n1</span>), and Xj = 
	  (<span class="cws_code_q">GetRGBSpace_n2</span>). (WARNING:Round your answer to ONE decimal place)
	  
   </p>
   <p><span class="cws_code_a">GetRGBSpace</span></p>
   <h2>Part 4</h2>
   <p>
	  <p>HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value), in 3D space, HSV can be represented as a Hexagonal-pyramid model.</p>
	  <p>V is the middle axis of the pyramid,H is the Angle, and S is the distance from the middle axis.</p>
	  <p>Given a HSV value = (<span class="cws_code_q">GetHSVSpace_n1</span>), and another HSV value = 
	  (<span class="cws_code_q">GetHSVSpace_n2</span>). Find the Distance between these two HSV Value in 3D space. </p>
	  <p>(WARNING:Round your answer to ONE decimal place) </p>
	  
   </p>
   <p><span class="cws_code_a">GetHSVSpace</span></p>
   <h2>Part 5</h2>
   <p>
	  <p>Given the RGB colour coordinates C = (<span class="cws_code_q">GetRGBcood</span>) in 3D space,</p>
	  <p>What is the corresponding HSV value in 3D HSV space? </p>
	  <p>(WARNING: Format of answer:(H,S,V), MUST round to ONE decimal place and no spaces between) </p>
	  
   </p>
   <p><span class="cws_code_a">GetHSVcood</span></p>
   <h2>Part 6</h2>
   <p>
	  <p>Given the HSV colour value C = (<span class="cws_code_q">GetH2Rvalue</span>) in 3D space,</p>
	  <p>What is the corresponding RGB coordinates in 3D RGB space? </p>
	  <p>(WARNING: Format of answer:(R,G,B), MUST keep a whole number, no roundin or DP needed and no spaces between) </p>
	  
   </p>
